    /* NOTE: Rust's match expressions is basically C's 
       switch statement on steroids and allows you to make 
       decisions, depending on what value the variable has 
       and whether it has advanced filtering capabilities. 

       * Within braces, we write expressions â€“ these are 
       * alled match arms.
       
       * Every match arm must return the same type.
       
       Like if else expressions, the return value of a match 
       expression can also be assigned to a variable in a let 
       statement when it's delimited with a semicolon, with 
       all match arms returning the same types.
